## My process

I began by mapping out the HTML, laying out the div with as much foresight as possible. I then began working on the Javascript portion. All of the variables were saved at the top of the file, ]then the mathematical functions were defined. Then came the DOM manipulation. Event listeners were added by grouping the various elements and using the forEach method. Lastly, the layout was done, which proved to be the most difficult task. Flexbox was used to achieve the resulting layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
